	<a href="https://youtu.be/sSvAFjpLaGA">Dear Martina,</a>
	loving you opened me to so many things in life I never knew existed. 
	At a point, I had to scan my whole life only to realize that you are everything I needed.
	If air and oxygen is for the lungs, then You are for me and my heart.
	If I were a flower, You'd be my sun.
	If rainy days were dark and gloomy, You'd be the rainbow that shines beautifully after.
	Baby, I miss hearing you burst out into laughter. To me, those days are one of the sweetest moments in my life.
	My heart flutters just with the thought of You, my girlfriend, my partner, my darling, my future wife.
	You are my queen, and if love was a battle, then I've already won because to love You and what i feel for you
	I had never felt before I met you.
	You are the best gift any man can receive, and I am the only one who can have You.
	A gift that only my heart can decipher.
	Love, you are my family, and I hope that one day we can be together without any restrictions so that 
	we can love each other as much as we can and want.
	Today, we celebrate our first anniversary and all I can say is I appreciate you and I love you.
	Have a beautiful day and life, my love.
	All my love,
	Ry
	I must have sent four hundred poems on the way you used to smile at me
	I used to write them for you daily but my thumbs are running dry lately
	No one wants to hear a song about the bitch that broke my heart
	I should've listened to my mama, she saw through you from the start

	But now we're here in Regent's Park amongst the flowers
	And I wish it would rain
	'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely that I'm falling for you over again
	Since I have nothing left to say that will make you change your mind
	I'll say goodbye on a beautiful spring day

	There was a place not too dissimilar to this one where I first saw your face
	You look like home, sat all alone
	I shoulda found somebody cheaper to chase
	Tragically, nobody told me how expensive you could be
	I lost more than money, dear, you knocked the swagger out of me

	But now we're here in Regent's Park amongst the flowers	
	And I wish it would rain
	'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely that I'm falling for you over again
	Since I have nothing left to say that will make you change your mind
	Make you change your mind
	I'll say goodbye on a beautiful spring day

I used to write them for you daily but my thumbs are running dry lately
No one wants to hear a song about the bitch that broke my heart
I should've listened to my mama, she saw through you from the start

But now we're here in Regent's Park amongst the flowers
And I wish it would rain
'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely that I'm falling for you over again

I'll say goodbye on a beautiful spring day

There was a place not too dissimilar to this one where I first saw your face
You look like home, sat all alone
I shoulda found somebody cheaper to chase
Tragically, nobody told me how expensive you could be
I lost more than money, dear, you knocked the swagger out of me

'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely that I'm falling for you over again
Since I have nothing left to say that will make you change your mind
(Make you change your mind)
